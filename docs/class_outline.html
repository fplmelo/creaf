<div id="goals-and-philosophy" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Goals and Philosophy</strong></h2>
<p>My research strategy is focused on the study of the ecology and
management of social-ecological landscapes. To achieve this, I pursue to
establish an interdisciplinary research group built on partnerships
across many disciplines such as landscape ecology, functional ecology,
ecological restoration and political ecology. My research vision for the
next three years is to consolidate a world-class research group on the
study of coupled social and ecological systems, delivering high impact
contributions to both science and to the resolution of real-world
problems of biodiversity conservation and the improvement of human
livelihoods.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals I draw on the social-ecological systems
framework and tools to address the interlinkages between biodiversity
and human activities in novel landscapes. Therefore, I am interested in
all kinds of interactions between human activities and biodiversity that
happens in working landscapes created by humans such as rangelands and
fragmented forest landscapes. Natural resources use, biological
invasion, changes in community assembly pattern and processes as well as
ecological restoration and conservation policies are among my main
research interests. I am trained in natural sciences, specifically in
ecology but my interests towards interdisciplinary research that have
always been intense, has increased in the last few years. I am very
interested in conducting research with a strong ecological ground and
clear management application aiming at the sustainability of tropical
human-modified landscapes.</p>
</div>
<div id="historic-of-contributions-to-science" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Historic of contributions to science </strong></h2>
<p>Many of my colleagues credit me as having a sharp critical thinking
that takes me beyond my comfort zone when doing science. Early in my
career I experienced writing reviews and perspective papers in leading
journals such as Biological Conservation and Trends in Ecology and
Evolution. My innovative ideas on social-ecological systems are
expressed on pieces that discuss: The role of human-modified landscapes
in maintaining biodiversity (Melo et al 2013); How proliferation of
disturbance-adapted species cause biotic homogenization (Tabarelli et al
2012); How to scale-up long lasting restoration projects (Melo et al
2013b); Assessing alternative successional pathways in Tropical forests
(Arroyo-Rodríguez et al. 2017) and recently, introducing the novel
concept of “forest security” as a fourth dimension for the water, energy
and food security nexus (Melo et al 2021). I have also contributed to
many other cutting edge ideas and scientific debates on themes related
to landscape ecology such as the debate around whether forest
fragmentation is good or bad to biodiversity. I consider that I am able
to constantly think on new and integrative ideas that address how
human-made landscapes can (or cannot) maintain both biodiversity and
human livelihoods.</p>
<p>I have a strong publication record with a vast network of
collaborators from many countries. In Brazil, where I am based, I am
part of the scientific committee of the Brazilian Platform for
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (the Brazilian chapter of the IPBES)
and I am part of the public policy workgroup of the Brazilian
Association of Ecologists (ABECO). I am currently leading a research
team working simultaneously on two multi-institutional projects funded
by the Brazilian National Council for Research Development (CNPq). I
have co-organized three symposiums in international meetings (SER 2011;
ATBC 2013 and 2017). In 2014 I first-authored a paper that called for
the action to conserve the three-banded armadillo and its habitat, the
Brazilian dry forest, after this animal was chosen as the official
mascot of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. This resulted in a huge campaign and
media coverage that ended up with the creation of a 110,000 hectares
protected area after my personal participation in political negotiation
and the elaboration of supporting studies for the creation of this
protected area. This story of success in conservation is taught in a
second paper (Bernard and Melo 2019) and in a video (see here).</p>
</div>
<div id="research-vision-future-plans-and-networking"
class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Research vision, future plans and networking </strong></h2>
<p>My research strategy aims to delve deeper into the ecology and
management of human-dominated landscapes. I foresee plenty of
opportunities to apply for and get grants from varying external and US
sources such as National Science Foundation - NSF and diverse
international funds from private institutions and NGOs. My past research
income records are solid and provided a constant flux of economic
resources for funding my research. My plan in Cornell for the next few
years is to build a dedicated research group on ecology and management
of social-ecological landscapes. My links with Brazilian and Mexican
institutions allow the establishment of large research programs based on
Latin America with access to funds from these countries in cooperation
with a network of collaborators. I have developed a broad and productive
network of strong scientific collaborations with researchers from
institutions in the UK (e.g. co-supervising PhD students, project
co-management and previous sabbatical visit to Lancaster University with
Dr. Luke Parry), USA (e.g. CO-I on PARTNERS project with Dr. Robin
Chazdon at University of Connecticut), Mexico (e.g. co-running
postgraduate field courses in Mexico and Brazil with Dr. Victor
Arroyo-Rodríguez, UNAM). This is reflected in my publishing record of
co-authored papers in journals including PNAS, Biological Reviews and
Ecology Letters.</p>
<p>I am now coordinating two simultaneous projects funded by the
Brazilian Council for Research Development (CNPq) that covers many
aspects of the aims and objectives of this job advertisement. These
projects involve both undergraduate and graduate students, financial
support for field trips and consultancy contracts to compile, manage and
analyze databases on forest cover and social-economic indicators of a
region composed of nine states where more than 26 million people
inhabit. I want to highlight the project entitled “Effects of climate
change on forest security of the Caatinga ecosystem in Brazil”. This
project fits perfectly with the goals of the Cornell Atkinson Center for
Sustainability and UN Sustainable Development Goals. This project aims
to understand human dependency on forest services and goods as well as
rights of access to these services for local, traditional communities.
Therefore, this is a great opportunity to move to Cornell with an
ongoing and financed project that would help me to establish prompt
collaborations with the staff of the Department of Natural Resources and
the Environment at Cornell University.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that natural and social sciences have been wrongly
and unfortunately understood as separate fields of knowledge. My
research vision is to contribute to construct effective bridges between
these two sciences through a world-class research program that I would
like to develop in the vibrant environment of the University of
Cornell.</p>
