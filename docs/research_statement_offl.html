<div id="research-overview" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Research overview</strong></h2>
<p>The broad question that guides my research program is: <strong>How
biodiversity and human livelihoods are intertwined in human-modified
landscapes?</strong> To answer this question, I draw on both the
theoretical and analytical tools of natural sciences and on the
social-ecological systems (SES) framework. I am interested in all kinds
of interactions between biodiversity (especially plants) and human
activities that take place in working landscapes such as rangelands,
farmlands, peri-urban and fragmented landscapes.</p>
<p>Along my career I have been assessing biodiversity conservation
problems through many lenses such as: The role of human-modified
landscapes in maintaining biodiversity <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534713000037">(Melo
et al 2013)</a>; How proliferation of disturbance-adapted species cause
biotic homogenization <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534721000562">(Filgueiras
et al 2021)</a>; How to scale-up long lasting restoration projects <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1462901113001494">(Melo
et al 2013)</a> and assessing alternative successional pathways in
Tropical forests <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12231">(Arroyo-Rodríguez
et al. 2017)</a>. Recently, I introduced the novel concept of “forest
security” as a fourth dimension for the water, energy and food security
nexus <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00608-z">(Melo
et al 2021)</a>. Briefly, my research interest is to address how
human-made landscapes can (or not) maintain both biodiversity and human
livelihoods.</p>
<p>My plans for the next years at the Copernicus Institute is to build a
dedicated research group on <strong>sustainable management of
social-ecological landscapes</strong>, working on the interface between
ecological and social sciences. This is the result of the maturity and
development of my critical thinking on the drivers of biodiversity
rearrangements in human-dominated ecosystems. Landscapes are not
naturally given, but constructed, even the “wildest” ones. Therefore, I
believe that an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation demands
the assessment of both human and non-human components of a
landscape.</p>
<p>In the short to medium term, this research program aims to address
the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What drives the resilience of both human and plant communities in
working landscapes in seasonally dry tropical forests?</li>
<li>How are biodiversity and ecosystem functions related in dry tropical
ecosystems?</li>
<li>What is the contribution of nature to human livelihoods in
Neotropical dry forests?</li>
</ol>
<p>The long-term goal is to create a synthesis working group aiming to
quantify nature’s contributions to people across tropical dry forests
while assessing how human activities modify both taxonomic and
functional diversity of tropical social-ecological landscapes. I draw on
both conceptual and analytical tools from landscape ecology, functional
ecology and social-ecological systems frameworks.</p>

<div id="current-research-projects" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Current research projects</strong></h2>
<p>I can bring to Copernicus Institute two established projects with
associated grants.</p>
<div
id="assessing-the-role-of-forests-for-water-energy-and-food-secutiries"
class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Assessing the role of forests for water, energy and food
secutiries</strong></h3>
<p>This project aims to understand human dependencies on forest services
through the quantification of the concept of “forest security” that adds
a new dimension to the water, energy and food security nexus
(WEF-Nexus). I am the principal investigator (PI) of this project and
received a grant from the Brazilian Science Council (CNPq). I lead a
diverse team formed by a research team of academic staff and graduate
students from three countries (USA, UK and Brazil). This grant is in the
final phase and there is only an academic visit scheduled to happen
during 2022 to meet Dr. Luke Parry from Lancaster University, UK.</p>

<div id="cdeep---caatina-dry-ecosystem-ecological-program"
class="section level3">
<h3><strong>cDEEP - Caatina Dry Ecosystem Ecological
Program</strong></h3>
<p>The second research project aims to assess the relationships between
biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF). Changes in alpha and beta
diversity (considering both the taxonomic and functional dimensions)
must affect how human-impacted ecosystems function and this can be
assessed through many types of stressors such as: fire, nutrient
availability and biological invasion. This research program is part of a
global network of experiments on dry forests <a
href="https://nutnet.org/dragnet">(NutNet-DAGnet)</a> and a drone-view
of the site can be seen in this <a
href="https://youtu.be/C21RHdxeu3E">video</a>. In this long-term
ecological experiment conducted in collaboration among Brazilian
colleagues we want to assess how stressors linked to typical land use of
the Brazilian dry forest such as goats pastoralism, slash-and-burn
agriculture and biological invasion affect the assembly patterns and
processes of biological communities of plants and insects.</p>
<p><img src=images/cdeep.jpeg></p>
<p>I count with a broad and productive network of well established
scientific collaborations with researchers from institutions in the UK
(e.g. co-supervising PhD students, project co-management and previous
sabbatical visit to Lancaster University with Dr. Luke Parry), USA
(e.g. CO-I on PARTNERS project with Dr. Robin Chazdon at University of
Connecticut), Mexico (e.g. co-running postgraduate field courses in
Mexico and Brazil with Dr. Víctor Arroyo-Rodríguez, UNAM).</p>

<div id="why-copernicus-institute" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Why Copernicus Institute? </strong></h2>
<p>Many of my colleagues credit me as having a sharp critical thinking
that takes me beyond my comfort zone when doing science. Early in my
career I experienced writing reviews and perspective papers where I
could share somo of my reflections on the ecology and management of
altered forest ecosystems. My innovative ideas on social-ecological
systems are expressed on pieces that discuss: The role of human-modified
landscapes in maintaining biodiversity <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713000037">(Melo
et al 2013)</a>; How proliferation of disturbance-adapted species cause
biotic homogenization <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320712002893?via%3Dihub">(Tabarelli
et al 2012)</a>; How to scale-up long lasting restoration projects <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113001494">(Melo
et al 2013b)</a>; Assessing alternative successional pathways in
Tropical forests <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12231">(Arroyo-Rodríguez
et al. 2017)</a> and recently, introducing the novel concept of “forest
security” as a fourth dimension for the water, energy and food security
nexus <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00608-z">(Melo
et al 2021)</a>. I have also contributed to many other cutting edge
ideas and scientific debates on themes related to landscape ecology such
as the debate around whether forest fragmentation is <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.12.026">good</a> or <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.07.022">bad</a> to
biodiversity. I consider that I am able to constantly think on new and
integrative ideas that address how human-made landscapes can (or cannot)
maintain both biodiversity and human livelihoods. I have a strong
publication record in leading journals with a broad network of
collaborators from many countries.</p>
<p>My contributions to society goes beyond the academic world. In
Brazil, where I am based, I am part of the <a
href="https://www.bpbes.net.br/quem-somos/biografias/">scientific
committee of the Brazilian Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services</a> (the Brazilian chapter of the IPBES). Recently I was
selected as <strong>lead author</strong> for the and I am part of the
public policy workgroup of the Brazilian Association of Ecologists
(ABECO). I am currently leading a research team working simultaneously
on two multi-institutional projects funded by the Brazilian National
Council for Research Development (CNPq). I have co-organized three
symposiums in international meetings (SER 2011; ATBC 2013 and 2017). <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12114">In 2014
I first-authored a paper</a> that called for the action to conserve the
three-banded armadillo and its habitat, the Brazilian dry forest, after
this animal was chosen as the official mascot of the 2014 FIFA World
Cup. This resulted in a <a

coverage</a> that ended up with the creation of a 110,000 hectares
protected area after my personal participation in political negotiation
and the elaboration of supporting studies for the creation of this
protected area. This story of success in conservation is taught in a <a
href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12681">second
paper</a> and in a <a

<div id="research-vision-future-plans-and-networking"
class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Research vision, future plans and networking </strong></h2>
<p>My plan at the Copernicus Institute, for the next three years, is to
build a dedicated research group on sustainable management of
social-ecological tropical landscapes. Joining the C staff of
researchers is a singular opportunity to establish productive scientific
partnerships with its highly regarded team of scientists The Copernicus
Institute expertises cover several of my research interests under all
main research areas of: Global Change, Biodiversity, Earth Observation
and Ecosystem Functioning. Furthermore, I see my research program
contributing to many of the six cross-cutting topics such as Forests,
Ecosystem Services, Sustainability and Citizen Science, for example.</p>
<p>I can contribute readily to the Copernicus Institute portfolio of
research grants as I am now coordinating two simultaneous projects
(until December 2023) funded by the Brazilian Council for Research
Development (CNPq) that fits many research expertise of the Copernicus
Institute and attend to the desired expertise of candidates for this job
advertisement. In a few words, these projects aim to understand the role
of climate change, biological invasion and natural resource uses on
plant communities, human livelihoods and ecosystem service provision of
the Brazilian seasonal tropical dry forests. Additionally, I plan to
apply for EU grants such as the ones from <a
href="https://erc.europa.eu/">ERC</a> (e.g. Consolidator Grants) and/or
diverse international funds from private institutions and NGOs.</p>
<p>I follow the research outputs of some Copernicus Institute
researchers such as Dr. Francisco Lloret Maya and Professor Maurizio
Mencuccini and their work on the functional ecology of drought
resistance. Impossible not to be excited with the possibility meet in
person and, if possible, work with Professor Josep Penuelas, one of the
world’s most important ecology scientists. Also, Dr. Joan Pino Vilalta,
current Copernicus Institute director, runs an interesting research
program on landscape ecology, one of my fields of expertise. Many other
researchers from other UAB departments such as the ICREA are references
for my current and future work.</p>
<p>My actual links with Brazilian and Mexican institutions allow me to
expand Copernicus Institute research scope and influence to Latin
America with access to funds from these countries in cooperation with a
network of collaborators. I have developed a broad and productive
network with researchers from institutions in the UK
(e.g. co-supervising PhD students, project co-management and previous
sabbatical visit to Lancaster University with Dr. Luke Parry), USA
(e.g. CO-I on PARTNERS project with Dr. Robin Chazdon at University of
Connecticut) and Mexico (e.g. co-running postgraduate field courses in
Mexico and Brazil with Dr. Victor Arroyo-Rodríguez, UNAM). This is
reflected in my publishing record in journals including Nature
Sustainability, PNAS, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, Biological
Reviews and Ecology Letters.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that moving to Copernicus Institute represents a
great opportunity to expand and redraft my career. My personal research
mission is to contribute to construct effective bridges between ecology
and society and this fits nicely with Copernicus Institute’s mission and
vision. I look forward to have a chance to establish an innovative and
productive research program in the vibrant environment of the
<strong>Copernicus Institute</strong>.</p>
