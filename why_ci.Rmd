## **Vision**

*"Our high-impact research is focused around four core themes: the natural environment; ecology and conservation; sustainable agriculture and food security; and animal behaviour, performance and welfare. We aspire for excellence through international and interdisciplinary collaboration, and foster a research environment that rewards innovation. Our research is recognised both nationally and internationally, often informing professional practice across the sector."*

The vision of ARES-NTU strongly matches my own research vision and my career outputs. I run a laboratory of [Applied Ecology](ecoaplic.org) where I strive to keep a research program that generates relevant contribution to both basic sciences and to applied ones. I am part of the scientific committee of the [Brazilian Platform of Biodiversitty and Ecosystem Services - BPBES](www.bpbes.net.br) where I took part on the production of two reports for decision makers. Actually, I am also the lead author of a chapter (*Chapter 5.4: Options for delivering sustainable approaches to elements of the nexus (biodiversity conservation, restoration and sustainable use*) in the upcoming Nexus Assessment of the [IPBES](https://ipbes.net/nexus). I had crucial role in many political decision with impacts on biodiversity conservation such as elaboration of national plans for restoration and creation of protected areas. I also had a short but life-changing experience while working as head of an NGO dedicated to conservation and restoration, [Cepan](www.cepan.org.br). I use to write to newspapers and digital media because I strongly believe that communication with citizens is crucial to improve impact of my research ([see example here](https://ecoaplic.org/en/#about)).

## **Research Network**

My plan at the ARES, for the next three years, is to build a dedicated research group on **sustainable management of social-ecological tropical landscapes**. I carefully examined the research lines of many researchers based at NTU and my research interest seems to both strengthen current interdisciplinary expertise and create a novel research focus with a solid ground on biodiversity sciences. I foresee many opportunities to engage in ongoing research groups and projects as well as I see myself being a hub for new opportunities of collaborations for team of scientists of the NTU. In my cover letter I highlighted some potential collaborations I could anticipate based on research profiles published. With time, I found many more amazing researchers that I'd be honored to work with. 


## **Teaching plans**


### *Field-course of ecology and conservation of novel landscapes*

This course is intended to develop abilities of: biodiversity inventories, landscape analyses, basic R programming and biodiversity conservation. The course combines theoretical and practical exercises divided into individual short projects (1 day); group projects (2 days) and a final individual long project (5 days). All projects count with the help of a teacher for planning and design of experiments and analyses. The whole workflow, from planning to the oral presentation of the results in the form of a symposium (usually at night) must be completed within the duration of projects. Written reports are peer reviewed and published in the form of an e-Book.

### *Landscape and restoration ecology*

Landscape description and analysis is a challenge for ecological studies and this course is intended to offer the basics of landscape ecology applied to restoration, focusing on the main concepts and analytical tools as well as the current debates on non-consensual ideas on what landscape's structure is optimal for conservation of biodiversity.

### *Political ecology*

Who benefits and who must cope with the burdens of environmental problems and conservation policies? Notions of critical geographies, environmental justice, conservation thinking and sustainability are the bases of this course that uses both national and geopolitical agendas as frameworks to evaluate the geopolitics of biodiversity.
